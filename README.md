# DocLab
Google Docs extension that provides Real-time Collaborative Programming (RCP) in one or multiple languages. The collaborative editing environment will be leveraged to create a quick, portable, shared software development environment for quick code demos/sketches.
### Motivation
When demonstrating ideas or starting sketches of projects, there are not many options for writing and running programs on a portable, low-maintenance, multi-user interface. Version control systems, though a robust tool, may be unnecessarily cumbersome in terms of setup, sharing, and synchronization for the early stages of a project when ideas and structures are still a flexible work in progress. For quick code sketches, it is more convenient to have a simple shared document. This is the role DocLab is meant to fill: a convenient, real-time collaborative programming environment for demonstrating and testing small-scale ideas before deployment in full-scale applications.
